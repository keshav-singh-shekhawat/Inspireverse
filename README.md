- ## Challenges & Learning Experience

- As a 2nd-year student, I am still learning web development, so structuring a 5-page responsive website was challenging.  
- Integrating the contact form with Formspree and ensuring it works correctly on GitHub Pages took time to debug.  
- Styling images, cards, and quotes to look visually appealing required experimenting with CSS properties like `object-fit`, gradients, shadows, and hover effects.  
- Making the site responsive for both desktop and mobile was tricky, especially maintaining proper spacing and alignment.  
- Overall, this project strengthened my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, and gave me practical experience in hosting a real website online.

- Excellent! Step 5: How to View / Access the Website.
